first programming assignment in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Finance Specialization

**Key Concepts:**
* Explain generalization as a goal of machine learning.
* Interpret bias-variance tradeoff in complex and simple models.
* Illustrate on example the No Free Lunch Theorem.
* Interpret a statistical method as the first ML algorithm.
* Describe how different is ML from statistical modeling.
* Choose hyperparameters using cross-validation.
* Apply methods of linear and logistic regressions learned in the course to FDIC banking call report data in the course project.
